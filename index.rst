Eyepiece Observations with the Auxiliary Telescope
##################################################

.. abstract::

   This Technote serves as a guide for performing eyepiece-based observations with the Auxiliary Telescope.

Introduction
============

.. note::
   **Eyepiece observations with the Auxiliary Telescope (AuxTel) require prior approval from Kevin Reil, Sandrine Thomas or Roberto Tighe.**

.. warning::
   Mandatory Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) required during eyepiece-based observations:

   #. Safety boots.
   #. Hard hat.
   #. High-visibility vest or jacket.
   #. Cold weather gear.
   #. Flashlight.

.. danger::
   This mode of observing with AuxTel requires personnel to be on the telescope floor while the telescope and dome are moving.
   The safety door interlock will have to be overridden.
   **Extreme caution is advised at all times.**

   **Collision hazard** with the telescope structure, dome, and telescope floor tables and equipment. **Please maintain a safe distance from the telescope mount.**

   **Fall hazard** on the telescope floor. **Please be aware of your surroundings while walking on the second floor of the telescope building, especially during nighttime.**

   **Entrapment hazard** with the telescope structure and dome. **Please maintain a safe distance from the telescope mount and from the mount.**

   **Electrical hazard** with the dome slip-ring. **Please maintain a safe distance from the dome.**
   
Procedure - Starting Observations
=================================

#. **Prior authorization for AuxTel eyepiece observations from Kevin Reil, Sandrine Thomas or Roberto Tighe is mandatory.**

#. Ensure the mandatory PPE is worn before entering the AuxTel building.

#. Post a message in the Slack channels *summit-auxtel* and *summit-announce* communicating that you are about to start eyepiece-based observations with AuxTel.
   Additionally, inform the Observing Specialist (OS) on-duty about this.

#. Confirm with the OS on-duty that all ATMCS and LATISS CSCs are in STANDBY. 
   This will ensure no remote operations can be performed and that the ATMCS CSC does not go into a fault mode when re-positioning the M3.

#. Inside the AuxTel building, go to the Safety Gate, and press the *Release* button. A click sound will be heard, releasing the mechanism that allows the door to be opened.
   **Be aware that opening the Safety Gate will trigger the interlock, disabling all telescope and dome movement.**

#. Push the black handle of the door to the left, and then open the door.

#. Go up to the second floor. 
   **Please maintain a safe distance from the telescope and dome at all times, and especially when the telescope is moving.**

#. **Eyepiece installation:**
   The eyepiece is stored in its labelled box, inside the spare part cabinet in the first floor of the AuxTel building. 
   Remove the plastic cover from the Nasmyth port #1 black tube, and carefully insert the eyepiece into the slot.
   While holding the eyepiece with one hand, tighten the two screws between the tube and the eyepiece with the other, securing the eyepiece.

#. **Tertiary mirror (M3) manual positioning:**
   The M3 motor is malfunctioning, and the positioning has to be made manually until the motor is replaced by the Electronics Group. 
   **2 people are needed for this procedure:**
   
   #. Identify the AT Pneumatics Box, beneath the telescope (see Figure 3 for reference), and open it using a screwdriver.
   #. Identify the M3 Indexer hose, and with the help of a screwdriver, depress the blue button highlighted in Figure 4.
   #. While one person holds the button depressed, the other one will have to manually rotate the M3 rotating table 180ยบ (see Figure 5).
   #. Once the M3 is in position, the blue button in the AT Pneumatics Box can be un-pressed. 
   #. A slight manual adjustment will be needed in M3, until the piston gets inserted (producing a sound during the insertion).
      This is important, since once the piston is engaged, the rotary table will be locked.

#. Before moving the telescope and dome, carefully inspect that there are no objects or people in the way.

#. Go down to the first floor, close the Safety Gate and pull the black handle to the right to lock it.

#. Press the lock button. 
   A click sound will be heard, engaging the lock.

#. Push the *Safety Gate Bypass* button on the ATMCS/Pneumatics (labeled AT Control Cabinet).
   This action will bypass the interlock that is triggered when the safety door is opened.

#. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to release the Safety Gate and open it.

#. **The following tasks must be performed by experienced personnel or an OS.** 
   Initialize the AuxTel telescope, dome, and shutters. 
   Slew to a target once all systems are ready for operations.
   auxtel/track_target.py can be used for this in ATQueue, with different options: slew_icrs to RA/Dec coordinates, slew_icrs to an object name, or slew_planet to a Solar System planet.

#. Once the telescope and dome are in position, you can begin observing with the eyepiece.
   A black and metallic step stool is available on the second floor, should it be needed to reach the eyepiece comfortably.

#. You can slide the eyepiece in and out to focus during observations. 
   In addition, two other screws in the lower part of the tube, when loosened, allow the entire tube to move, providing a greater focusing range.

Procedure - Ending Observations and Closure
===========================================

#. Execute the *shutdown_all.py* script in the LOVE ScriptQueue. This script will park the telescope and dome.

#. Once the telescope and dome are parked, and the corresponding CSCs are in ``STANDBY``, the eyepiece can be removed.
   While holding the eyepiece with one hand, loosen the two screws and carefully remove the eyepiece. 
   Return the eyepiece to its box and store it inside the spare part cabinet in the first floor of the AuxTel building. 

#. **M3 manual positioning (2 people are needed for this procedure):**
   Do not forget to put the M3 back to LATISS, following the same procedure as in the previous section.

#. Go downstairs to the first floor. 

#. Close the Safety Gate, and pull the black handle to the right to lock it.

#. Press the lock button. 
   A click sound will be heard, engaging the lock.

#. In the AT Control Cabinet, press the *Safety Gate Bypass* button to activate the Safety Gate Interlock. 
   The button will pop-out.

#. Close the door of the AuxTel building on your way out.

#. Post a message in the Slack channels *summit-auxtel* and *summit-announce* communicating that you are done with the eyepiece observations with AuxTel, and inform the Observing Specialist (OS) on-duty about it.
